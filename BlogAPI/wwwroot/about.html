            <h2>Why this exists</h2>
            <p>I built this website to learn how to make a full-stack web app with a C# + SQL Server API back-end being accessed by a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-end.</p>
            <h2>How I made it</h2>
            <p>I started by researching what impressive-looking blogs look like and how users are directed through each site. Taking that inspiration, I made a plan for how application data would flow from the front-end to the database and back, and sketched out my basic plans for the user interface. From there I started by writing the C# API in its most basic form, and then began to fill out the front-end. The front-end work revealed problems in the back-end, and after hours of debugging both, I had a finished application!</p>
