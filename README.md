# Blog
My programming blog, built with a C# .NET web API, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS

## Other Skills Used
This app was built using the C# XUnit and Cypress.js testing libraries, C# MailKit for notifications, C# Dapper for accessing MS SQL Server and running stored procedures, 
and currently (April) is deployed to Azure at [andreblog.azurewebsites.net](https://andreblog.azurewebsites.net), where I use an Azure DevOps pipeline to 
deploy any desired changes.
